                        College sports fans are interested in fantasy football, betting, scores, polls, and all things sports. Our solution should provide users with a way to compete online with other users with the sports and teams they love.

                    <p>
                          My group and I decided that as college football starts up again, fans, college students, alumni, and more should have a similar experience with fantasy football as professional sports fans do.
